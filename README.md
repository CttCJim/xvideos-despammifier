This is a script to make the site xvideos.com more convenient for free members. It removes most if not all references to pay content (xvideos RED) and links to "partner" sites.
To install it, you will need the TamperMonkey extension. It's available for Firefox and Chrome.
This script is well-commented and open-source, so you know I'm not trying to do anythign sinister. I'm merely making it for my own convenience ans as a personal challenge.
Want a custom adblock/de-spam script for another site? Let me know, we'll see what I can do!
